# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends for Louise

  In this project, I was helping a playwright, "Louise", who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her new play. In this project we used excel to organize, analyze, and sort a plethora of other crowdfunding data to determine for Louise if there are any specific factors which might make her projects campaign successful. These factors specifically analyzed were campaigns based on Launch Date and campaigns based on Funding Goal.
