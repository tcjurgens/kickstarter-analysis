# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

pertinent excel files for this project may be found in Kickstarter_challenge and Kickstarter_challenge 2 .xlsx files. ... had some errors when compiling all the data so my apologies for that. 
## Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends for Louise

In this project, I was helping a playwright, "Louise", who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her new play. In this project we used excel to organize, analyze, and sort a plethora of other crowdfunding data to determine for Louise if there are any specific factors which might make her projects campaign successful. These factors specifically analyzed were campaigns based on Launch Date and campaigns based on Funding Goal.

### Outcomes of Crowdfunding Campagins based on Launch Date

Above you can see an image of the Crowdfunding Campagins based on Launch date and whether or not they were successful. One can see that both no. of both failed and cancelled plays remains (relatively) constant throughout the year, where as successful plays appears to be much more volatile/ dependent on time of which the campaign is started. 

Below I have added another image showing the tabulated data for the Outcomes and success rated based on Launch Date of the campaign.

Two conclusions which may be made from this data would be that Campaigns are more likely to succeed (a higher percentage succeed) in in May/June than they would be if they launched during the winter months.  Another conclusion may be that there will always be a relative constant number of campaigns that fail/ are canceled each month. We may interpret this as there being a higher demand for theater in the summer months than the winter. 


### Outcomes of Crowdfunding Campaigns based on Fundraising Goal

Above you can see an image of Crowdfunding Campaigns based on Fundraising Goal. Other than the range of ~$35k to $45k~ the data seems to trend downward, where plays with less ambitious goals are more likely to succeed than fail,  and vice versa.  

This portion of the graph which we mention may be attributed to outliers. As crowdfunding campaigns became more ambitious, there were less campaigns in these fundraising goal ranges (as one may expect). in the 35k - 45k range there are only 9 total projects,  6 of which are successful. This 66.7% success rate is greater than the ~54% success rate of which Louises project lives: however, with such a small sample size it would be irresponsible to reccomend to Louise that she raiase her fundraising goal in order to give her a better chance to fund her project. 

It is safer to assume that fundraising projects with more modest goals are more likely to succeed than fail,  especially becasue of the size of the data in these ranges comparative to more extreme figures.

Below I have added another image showing the tabulated data for the Outcomes and success rates based on Fundraising Goals.

### Possible Limitations

We of course do not know everything about the data from this sheet alone. There are undoubatably unknown factors which go into each campaigns success/failure which we are not able to convey in an excel sheet.   

Narrowing in on Date Launched and Fundraising Goal are good ones to start with, but more catagories analyzed will often lead to a better understanding of the data. 

I quickly filtered through some other data and noticed immediately that theater campaigns with the highest number of backers/contributors succeed much more often than not-- and this seems independent of the fundraising goal. One may also notice at a glance that theater fundraisers in the range of ~10k like Louises play can struggle to receive attention. One play, The Esocertic Camgirl, received $0 of its $10k goal in two months of the campaign being open. 

The long and the short is that there is no exact formula for us to give Louise. We can do the best with what data we have-  and while the date started and fundraising goals are no doubt important factors to analyze-- I feel that there are many more that need be explored before feeling comfortable giving Louise a confident reccomendation.
